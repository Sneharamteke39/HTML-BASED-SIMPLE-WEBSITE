<h3 class="text-white "><em>Generally, this acting takes different forms like we can name it as Drama,skit,daily soap,film etc.</em></h3>

<h3 class="text-white "><em>In Drama-- the acting is done based on live performance like there is daily practice on the story plotted and then presenting it in LIVE ,where your facial expression matters a lot and even your body language which shows acting in natural and realistic  way.</em> </h3>

<h3 class="text-white"><em>In skit-- its same as drama but its not like discribing whole story .Just a way to convey message where 
	<strong>"ACTION SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS" </strong>and this action is nothing but the acting.</em></h3>

<h3 class="text-white ">In daily soaps---we see acting which have lots of editing and effects in it.This type of acting is more focused on obsession of people. The more people feel acting real,the more they will watch it daily. </h5>	

<h3 class="text-white ">In films---its as same as above forms ,or we can say it a mixture of above forms . </h3>
